Hi there 👋 I'm Ákos, software engineer at [@Facebook](https://github.com/facebook), working on static code analysis. I did my PhD at [@ftsrg](https://github.com/ftsrg/) in formal methods 🧑‍🎓 Formerly I interned at [@SRI-CSL](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/) and [@CERN](https://github.com/CERN) 🌎. In my free time I skate 🛹 and take photos 📷.
